- Hello, I'm @anstksta, u can call me Nastya
- I'm interested in business analytics and the application of IT technologies for business. During my studies, I was very interested in frontend-dev, so I have a good command of HTML5 and CSS and had experience working with JS
- Iâ€™m currently learning to model business processes, work with databases (PostgreSQL, DBeaver), study marketing (also Internet marketing separately), enterprise IT infrastructure and data flow management models and methods
- I'm looking for internships to increase my knowledge and skills and consolidate them
